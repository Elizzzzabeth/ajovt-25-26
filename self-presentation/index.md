# 🧝🏻‍♀️ (s)ELF PRESENTATION

###### Hellllllo, welcome to my presentation page! Here you can find some of my works & a few more things about me 😛 Ready? Let’s start!*

![Introductory slide](img/intro.png)

Hi everybody 👋 My name is Eli, I’m a multidisciplinary artist, and I would like to share with you three projects I worked on during my university graphic design course. But at first, let me introduce myself and briefly describe who I am.

![Who am i?](img/who-am-i.png)

I'm person who create work that likes to exist across multiple media at once. I enjoy experimenting with all kinds of things ~ different media, formats, textures, typefaces, and approaches ~ whether it’s to find the right solution for a specific project or simply out of curiosity, when I have an idea that I want to communicate. I bring colors and a bit of creative chaos into everything I do, keeping my work vibrant and never boring.  

I'am currently open to collaborations and commissions, also to unusual problems. Bonus points if they involve glue sticks, and concepts driven by experimenting rather than rules.

The first work I'll show you was created for a typography class. The assignment was to design a propaganda poster with complete creative freedom, but I chose to avoid direct political messaging and instead focused on health, creating a fictional campaign about junk food and its impact on the body.

I made a poster as a digital collage composed of various junk food elements, combined in Photoshop using textures, filters, and typography. As the result, we can see that food forms an angry, unsettling face where the main idea is to exaggerate the consequences of unhealthy eating. I think it works. My goal was rather than realism, create design that has a strong visual impact to communicate its message.

The second project was created during graphic design studio classes and focused on a more complex task, and that is designing a visual identity for the Frankfurt Book Fair, with the theme Czechia ~ Land on the Coast. 

As we all (hopefully) know the Czech Republic has no coastline, so I approached the topic conceptually rather than literally. I worked with paper as a symbol of the book and watercolor as a metaphor for water and coast, allowing color to flow naturally across the surface.

The result is a colorful visual system built around three main festival colors, combined with modern typography and a clear layout structure.

What else proper graphic designer does? Yes, you are right ~ applies identity across multiple outputs, including posters, booklets, merchandise, and social media content, creating a cohesive design system, which i also did, of course.

So one of that merchandise thing in a pencil form you can see right here.👆 Beautiful, ins't it?

![Third project - exhibition poster](img/de-stijl.png)

And we are almost in the finish! The third and last project I'll show you for now is a poster design. It was created as an assignment for a typography class and designed for an exhibition celebrating the 100th anniversary of the De Stijl movement. The exhibition focused on key figures of the movement and required working with a large amount of text. So I approached the task conceptually, concentrating the composition into a central cube inspired by a Rubik’s Cube.

In my opinion the cube structure reflects the core principles of De Stijl ~ radical abstraction, universalism, and the pursuit of harmony through neoplasticism. My design uses primary colors alongside black, white, and gray, as well as strict geometric forms and right angles. White space and typography here play an essential role in balancing the composition and translating the spirit of the movement into a contemporary visual form.

I would like to give you a little look behind the scenes of this project and show how I developed the cube concept. 

At first, I created sketches in Procreate, as you can see here, to make sure the composition was balanced and harmonious and to save time during the final design process. Right after i found the solution for it, I did a design which you saw in the previous slide.

And that brings us to the end. You’ve seen a selection of my university projects that I really enjoy, and I’d be happy to hear your feedback.

If you like my work, as I mentioned earlier, I’m open to new experiences, interesting projects, and collaborations, so feel free to contact me! And also if you’d like to see more of my work (not only graphic design), you can scan the QR code to my Instagram profile, where I share my multi art and thoughts 🤍
