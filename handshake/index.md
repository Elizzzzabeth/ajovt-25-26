# HANDSHAKE 🤝

### Versions

- Hi, I’m Elizabeth. I create work that likes to exist across multiple media at once. I enjoy experimenting with all kinds of things ~ different media, formats, textures, typefaces, and approaches ~ whether it’s to find the right solution for a specific project or simply out of curiosity, when I have an idea that I want to communicate. I bring colors and a bit of creative chaos into everything I do, keeping my work
vibrant and never boring.
Currently open to collaborations, commissions, and unusual problems. Bonus points if they involve glue sticks, and concepts driven by experimenting rather than rules.
