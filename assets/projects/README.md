# Alt Text

A thin, silver metal wire shaped like the letter S, possibly serving as a simple hook, clip, or fastener for lightweight use.

### Process Notes

- I experimented with several versions of the alt text, focusing on clarity and brevity.  
- I wanted to describe the **material** (silver metal), the **shape** (S-shaped wire), and a **possible function** (hook, clip) without stating anything as a fact that is not certain.

My design process always shifts depending on whether I am working from my own idea or responding to a specific assignment. The starting point, however, is always the same. I begin by visualizing everything and creating a mind map. This helps me structure my thoughts, see the relationships between ideas, and understand what direction I want to follow. It also gives me something to reflect on later in the process.

Once the initial mapping is done, I move into research and analysis. I explore relevant references, study context, and identify the needs or challenges of the project. From this, I form a basic strategy that guides my decisions moving forward.

Only after this foundation is set do I move into the creative phase. This is the part I enjoy the most: translating ideas into visuals, experimenting with forms, and shaping the final outcome. Even though each project develops differently, this combination of structure and creativity helps me stay focused while still allowing space for spontaneity and expression.
